## install packages

        sudo apt install ffmpeg jq xclip

### basic scripts for downloading files

* the majority of the rest of the repo are extra features wrapped around these simple comands. Copy them and paste into a text editor or directly into the terminal

    find mp4 on page, copy from ffmpeg

        read -p "Target (url): " targ && ffmpeg -i $(curl -s $targ |
        grep "\Khttps.*?mp4" -oPm 1) -c copy outfile.mp4

    find stream and rip to ffmpeg

        read -p "Target (url): " targ && ffmpeg -i $(curl $targ | \
        grep "\Khttps.*?m3u" -oP | grep "https" -m 1) -c copy outfile.mp4

     granicus platform specific

        read -p "Target (url): " targ && ffmpeg -i $(curl $targ -L |
        tr "\'" "\n" |  grep "\Khttp.*?m3u?8" -Poz |
        grep "m3u" -z -m 1) -c copy out.mp4

### working with Sliq pages

* these features are snippets of code for working wth Sliq, specifically around parsing subtitles and converting them to transcripts

    pull whole data model from Sliq, only show first 100 characters

        grep '(?s)dataModel = \{.*?\};' outfile_temp -Poz | tail +2 | head -c 100

    extract transcript from embedded VTT subtitles file

        curl $(targ) | grep -i '[a-z]' | sed  's/\r//g' | tr '\n' ' '

    make shortcut to allow any user to expand subtitles of file with URL in clipboard

        alias expvtt="curl $(xclip -selection clipboard -o) |
        grep -i '[a-z]' | sed  's/\r//g' | tr '\n' ' '
